Revision history for Perl extension Carp::Indeed.

0.02  Thu Aug  5 2005
        - POD minor fixes 
        - I should have said "NO_META => 1" in Makefile.PL instead
	  of "NO_META => 0"
        - "use Carp qw(verbose)" instead of "require Carp; $Carp::Verbose=1"
	  was enough for carp() and croak() to be verbose too
