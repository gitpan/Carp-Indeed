Revision history for Perl extension Carp::Indeed.

0.03  Mon Oct 10 2005
        - now using $SIG{__DIE__} and $SIG{__WARN__} to catch 
          perl generated warnings and errors as well 
        - added a test for perl generated warnings
        - renamed "t/003pod.t" to "t/090pod.t"
        - shortened "lib/Carp/Indeed.pm" to "Indeed.pm" (as
          this is a module of an only PM file)

        - POD minor fixes 
        - I should have said "NO_META => 1" in Makefile.PL instead
          of "NO_META => 0"
        - "use Carp qw(verbose)" instead of "require Carp; $Carp::Verbose=1"
          was enough for carp() and croak() to be verbose too
