0.06  Tue Aug 22 2006
        - this distribution is deprecated - use Carp-Always instead
          (and then just replace Carp::Indeed with Carp::Always)

0.05  Tue May 30 2006
        - remove @EXPORT_OK and all use of Exporter (which was good
          for nothing) - a suggestion by Yuval Kogman via CPAN ratings
        - simplified tests with Test::Base

0.04  Wed Oct 12 2005 (r198, tag)
        - fixed mistakes at META.yml and t/002basic.t
        - shortened documentation

0.03  Mon Oct 10 2005
        - now using $SIG{__DIE__} and $SIG{__WARN__} to catch 
          perl generated warnings and errors as well 
        - added a test for perl generated warnings
        - renamed "t/003pod.t" to "t/090pod.t"
        - shortened "lib/Carp/Indeed.pm" to "Indeed.pm" (as
          this is a module of an only PM file)

0.02  Thu Aug  5 2005
        - POD minor fixes 
        - I should have said "NO_META => 1" in Makefile.PL instead
          of "NO_META => 0"
        - "use Carp qw(verbose)" instead of "require Carp; $Carp::Verbose=1"
          was enough for carp() and croak() to be verbose too

0.01  Thu Aug  4 2005
        - first realease to CPAN

0.00  Thu Aug  4 13:07:27 2005
        - original version; created by h2xs 1.23 with options
                -AX -n Carp::Indeed
