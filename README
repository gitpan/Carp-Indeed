Carp-Indeed version 0.10
========================

The Carp-Indeed distribution was superseded by Carp-Always.
You find it here:

  http://search.cpan.org/dist/Carp-Always/

There you find the module Carp::Always which you should use.
Carp::Indeed is the former name of Carp::Always and is 
currently deprecate but will be here
as a courtesy to my user base - approximately 
000_000_1 user(s): me :)

This distribution is here as a redirection to people who
have met this dist some time ago 
and then remembered it could be useful to them. 

INSTALLATION

Never mind install this distribution. Go after Carp-Always.
