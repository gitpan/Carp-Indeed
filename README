Carp-Indeed version 0.02
========================

Carp::Indeed can be used to make a script complain loudly
with stack traces when warn()ing or die()ing.

  perl -MCarp::Indeed script.pl

This is a rant on the Acme::JavaTrace module where
the author (Sébastien Aperghis-Tramoni) gave us some 
pearls of wisdom like

  <buzzword>This module tries to improves the Perl programmer 
  experience by porting the Java paradigm to print stack traces, 
  which is more professional than Perl's way. </buzzword>

and

  Please note that even the professionnal indentation present 
  in the Java environment is included in the trace. 

Perl has Carp which is a module as old as Perl 5. It has
an option to print errors (from the perspective of caller) 
with stack backtrace. With a few lines of codes, this module
illustrates how to make warn() and die() noisy as well.
